❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope. This will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior
as the function will try to access variables from the outer scope (which might not exist).
* ❌ Function does not accept any arguments. A sum function should generally take the numbers to be summed as input.
* ❌ Missing JSDoc style documentation - what does this function do? What does it return?

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Calculates the sum of two numbers.
* @param {number} a - The first number.
* @param {number} b - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making it reusable and predictable.
* ✔️ The function operates on its own input, avoiding reliance on potentially undefined outer scope variables.
* ✔️ Added JSDoc documentation.

Final Note:

Always define the parameters your function needs within the function definition. This makes your code more
self-contained and easier to understand. Proper documentation also helps.
